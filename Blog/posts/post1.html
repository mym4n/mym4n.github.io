                    So I've been working on a story game for a while.
                    It's just a walking simlator basically. I'm trying
                    to pour a lot of the bad things I've experienced 
                    in life into it. I want it to be extremely personal 
                    and all that.

                    I think that all I can hope for in life is to make 
                    art that other people can enjoy, or at least get 
                    some catharsis from haha.

                    Well, there's that and making art I enjoy making.
                    That's always been a big goal of mine.

                    Anyways, it's not nearly done or anything like that.
                    I'm not even out of the prototype stage LOL!
                    I'll get there someday though. As long as I keep on
                    keeping on I know I can do it.

                    It's very challenging doing all of it by myself, but
                    I mean I wouldn't have it any other way honestly.
