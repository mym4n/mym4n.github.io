One of the methods that is used to remove plastic off of the necks of seals
is that a human will come from under a platform with slits that is above water
and cut the plastic ring that is around the seals neck.

A thought that I had is that the same thing could be happening to people 
when miracles happen to them. A supernatural being in this metaphor would
be the human that is "cutting" off a "plastic ring" around a humans neck.

Similar to a seal, the human wouldn't be aware of the "plastic ring".
They would think that it's just a normal thing to have in life,
or they *would* be aware that it's not normal but they wouldn't know 
what to do about it.

Maybe a story could center around a human becoming aware of the person or
people that are "cutting off the plastic rings".

There are a couple different questions to answer regarding this though.
- What is their motivations?
- What do they get out of it?
- What would they act like?
