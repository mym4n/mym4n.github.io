"if everything were catered to you then it would all be like that daycare game."

what are his preconcieved notions of the game? Probably what it says on the fucking tin.

why did he say that? To get at me when it was clear that he wasn't going to "win" the arguement against me. He knows his points are valid in his mind, but not in mine. So he decided to say something against me personally.

who had the power by the end of things? Him, he got the reaction that was coming to him from that. I said really bad things to him. Things that I regret and things that showed I was scared of him since he opened a wound.

how do I move on from this conversation? Well, he's obviously not going to apologize. I guess he's just not as close to me as I thought he was.

isn't that a bit... extreme? No, if he's comfortable saying things like that to me then he doesn't know me like I thought he did. I'm not sitting around someone who's comfortable making fun of me like that, even if it's for a joke.
